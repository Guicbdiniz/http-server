# http-server

Simple HTTP server built using the Go standard library.

It was developed for studying purposes only and should not be use in any type of production environment.

## Usage

Simply create a __HttpServer__ instance, add routes to it with the __SetUpRoute__ function and listen to any incoming requests using the __Listen__ function.

The _src/main_ module has a simple example to ilustrate the project usage.
